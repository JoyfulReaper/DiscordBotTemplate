DiscordBotTemplate
=================
A starting point to QUICKLY start building your own C#/Discord.NET Discord bot.

IMPORTANT
=========
The thumbnail images that are used in the Embeds need to be set in: ImageLookupUtility.cs You will receive array out of bound exception unless there is at least one image in each array!

Make sure that the appsettings.json file meets your needs.

The bot will prompt you for the token when it first starts, this is saved in DiscordBotSettings table of the SQLite database.

Sorry, there is little documentation at the time (other than the source code), this is from my own bot with much of the functionality stripped out. It does serve as an excellent base for your own bot though, all the planning and hard work is done! The template is based on this bot: https://github.com/JoyfulReaper/DiscordBot
